# ðŸš€ Youtube Toxicity Analysis App
This project is a YouTube comment analysis app that scrapes comments from a given YouTube video URL, classifies them according to a toxicity model, and provides an analysis of the comments based on their toxicity levels. The toxicity model utilized in this project is a Bidirectional LSTM model, and a vectorizer model is used to vectorize the text data.
